# Snack World 3DS

![Intro](/docs/intro.png)

### Description:
We are not Japanese or Translators, but we decided to pick this up as a side project due
to a huge amount of requests. This will be an ONLY UI translation and we will not translate the story.

This is our first 3DS translation attempt and we will do as we can.
We will be translating as close as possible as we can, but as well as avoiding confusing translations
that ended up in the switch localized version. So it will be as plain and direct as can be or as close as we 
seem fit.

### Version: 3.2

### Installation:
Apply xdelta patch Snack World 3DS - Game to archive_a.fa Main Games files.
Apply xdelta patch Snack World 3DS - Update to archive_a.fa to the 3.2 update files.


Both patches need to be applied due to the .fa formated files.
