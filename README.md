# Snack World 3DS

![Intro](/docs/intro.png)

### Description:
We are not Japanese or Translators, but we decided to pick this up as a side project due
to a huge amount of requests. This is our first 3ds translation attempt and we will do as we can.
I know the switch version is localized but alot of localization sounded stale or wrong. So The
translation we do, is to make it as obvious and straight forward as possible.

Compatible with Version 3.2

### Installation:
Apply xdelta patch to archive_a.fa game and update 3.2
