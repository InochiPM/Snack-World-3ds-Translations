### Description:
We are not Japanese or translators, but we decided to pick this up as a side project due to a huge amount of requests.
This will ONLY be a UI translation and we will not translate the story.

This is our first translation attempt and we will do the best we can. We will not be using the localization from the Switch version.
If you have any questions feel free to contact me.

## Version: 3.2

### Installation:
Extract both Main Game Cia and Update 3.2 Cia then navigate to romfs

Apply xdelta patch Snack World 3DS - Game to archive_a.fa Main Games files.

Apply xdelta patch Snack World 3DS - Update to archive_a.fa to the 3.2 update files.

Repack both Cia and install both cias.

Both patches need to be applied due to the .fa formated files, not all files in the main .fa are
in the updates .fa. So depending on updates, assure that before installing the main cia to create a backup
as it will delete your save file. Applying the updates cia will not delete your save file.
