### Description:
We are not Japanese or Translators, but we decided to pick this up as a side project due
to a huge amount of requests. This will be an ONLY UI translation and we will not translate the story.

This is our first 3DS translation attempt and we will do as we can.
We will be translating as close as possible as we can, but as well as avoiding confusing translations
that ended up in the switch localized version. So it will be as plain and direct as can be or as close as we 
seem fit.

## Version: 3.2

### Installation:
Extract both Main Game Cia and Update 3.2 Cia then navigate to romfs

Apply xdelta patch Snack World 3DS - Game to archive_a.fa Main Games files.

Apply xdelta patch Snack World 3DS - Update to archive_a.fa to the 3.2 update files.

Repack both Cia and install both cias.

Both patches need to be applied due to the .fa formated files, not all files in the main .fa are
in the updates .fa. So depending on updates, assure that before installing the main cia to create a backup
as it will delete your save file. Applying the updates cia will not delete your save file.

### Notes:
If you are a translator and feel the need to either help and lend a hand on some of the corrections, we are all ears.
